Scope of POC: Full-Stack AI Application Engineer
Please provide a "cut-down" version hat validates abilities to understand the core logic (RAG + Prompt
Engineering) without wasting time on boilerplate configuration.
Here is the project definition. It strips away the complexity to focus purely on logic and code quality.

Technical Assessment: The "Single-Video Twin"

Objective: Build a functional Proof of Concept (POC) that turns a single YouTube video URL into a
conversational AI agent. The agent should answer questions based strictly on the video content and
attempt to adopt the speaker's tone.
Timebox:
• Duration: 5 days maximum.
The Functional Requirements:
1. Ingestion:
o The user inputs a YouTube URL into a simple text field.
o The backend retrieves the transcript of that video (you may use youtube-transcript-api
or similar libraries).
2. Processing (RAG):
o Store the transcript in a temporary knowledge base (in-memory Vector Store or simple
ChromaDB/FAISS implementation is acceptable; no complex database required).
o Generate embeddings for the transcript chunks.
3. Interaction:
o Provide a simple chat interface.
o When the user asks a question, retrieve the most relevant information from the
transcript.
4. The "Twin" Aspect:
o The System Prompt must instruct the AI to answer only using the provided context.

The Tech Stack (Strict):
• Frontend: No design libraries needed, standard HTML/CSS is fine. We care about functionality,
not aesthetics.
• Backend: Python (Serverless functions are a plus).
• AI: free choice.
• Cloud: AWS, Azure or GCP
Deliverables:
1. GitHub Repository: Clean code structure, comments where necessary.
2. README.md: Clear instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project locally.
3. Demo Video (Loom/Screen recording): A 2-minute video showing the ingestion of a URL and a
chat interaction demonstrating the bot answering correctly based on the video.
